## How to interact with the code
> Instructions on how to interact with the work; e.g. move the mouse slowly over the screen, click the play button and wait for the music to start, load the page and the animation will happen over x number of seconds or whatever is needed to make your code come alive.


## Individual approach
**Chosen method: perlin noise and randomness.**

> Which properties of the image will be animated and how; highlighting how it is unique from other group members

### Inspiration
I chose to animate with perlin code because it can add some interesting textures to the artwork. The shapes in the base group code are all very smooth:

*Our group code*

With perlin noise, I want to add some textures so that our artwork can look a real painting. As can be seen in the inspiration artwork, a traditional painting has a lot of subtle textures that come from the oil paint, brush strokes, and canvas.

*Our group's inspiration artwork: Pacita Abad's Wheels of Fortune*

For inspiration of the animation movement, I referenced the film *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse* (2023), which is an animated film with a comic book style. Specifically, I took reference from the beginning of the film that shows a world that looks like a watercolour painting.

The scene I referenced can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek40XtVsO7g).

I was inspired by way the film was animated to look like a moving watercolour painting. Many of the backgrounds had random textures and lines that look like shapes I can make with perlin noise.
